# band_name_app_socket

This project was a socket service practice. I will be creating more projects to improve my skills like a 
Flutter developer.

This is a simple app band socket mobile application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
